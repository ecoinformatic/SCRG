# Statewide Predictors

The items below are the 71 statewide predictors included in the model selection workflow. This list can also be generated by sourcing the `wranglingCleaning.R` script and then using `colnames(pred)` in `R`. A large portion of these are predictors included in the Virginia Institude for Marine Science (VIMS) Living Shoreline Suitability (LSSM) framework (see [Nunez et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.106617))
