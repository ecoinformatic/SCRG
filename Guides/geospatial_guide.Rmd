# Setup

data in R.
```{r}
library(sf) # This is a major existing R library for managing geospatial data 
p <- paste( # This is the path to the geospatial data 
  "/media/thellinger/cs3pace1/data/choctawatchee_bay/", 
  "choctawatchee_bay_lssm.geojson", 
  sep=""
) # To keep this under 80 characters to show up in the PDF
